 asâ€”This operator converts a value of one class to another class when possible.
 
 The conversions are not always guaranteed, and that is why this operator comes in two forms: as! and as?.
 
 These versions of the as operator work in similar way as the optionals.
 The as! operator forces the conversion and returns an error if the conversion is not possible,
 
 and the as? operator tries to convert the object and returns an optional with the new object or nil in case of failure.
